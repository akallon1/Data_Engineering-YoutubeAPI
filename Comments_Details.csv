LgvJxtbZ4Mc,"[""Thanks for making this informative video. I was wondering how it is for a black person in Switzerland. As a Swiss person moving back after 6 years from the UK, which is much more culturally diverse, I realised there are a lot of things that Swiss people are ignorant to regarding race simply because we have never experienced it or didn't know it was happening. I have learned so much from my time in the UK and being exposed to so many different cultures, especially in London and I think it is very important for us to be more aware of it and educate ourselves here in Switzerland. I have also heard quite a few Swiss people saying we do not really have a problem with racism and whilst it may not be as bad as the US we definitely have some issues to improve on!"", 'Having difficulty following your video.', 'Boo fucking whooo.. always a victim. Go to da the hood then Mrs ""always a victim""', ""I am a black Swiss (&South Africa). I speak fluently Swiss German.  As long as I don't speak, I am recognized as an African refugee, and then they speak to me in broken German or English. For 40 years I have had to hear, that there is no racism in Switzerland. Unfortunately, I had different experiences. Yes, not all Swiss people are racist but many are ignorant. Nevertheless, people here have a certain image of black people that does not correspond to reality. That's how they were taught. \nI work for the school system. Unfortunately, I still find books that contain the word Niger. It doesn't seem to be a problem for most people here.There are many prejudices against people who have black skin."", 'An afronazi displaying the BLM/Antifa afronazi salute talking about racism.\n\nTras de afronazi, bufona.', 'Its everywhere dear!

We only want people to integrate. If Swiss people go to other countries we try to integrate! Maybe you are projecting way to much!', 'thts so sad to hear.....the way i love Switz, tht can damage smbds outlook on lyf!', 'From my life experience here in New York City, born and raised, I noticed every single race outside of black hates us.\n\nThe depth of hatred that is taught, or conditioned throughout media and propaganda, basically trains every race outside of black, that we’re the ugliest, scariest , humans (that are really not human) 🤔.. with that, we’re also considered beasts; which also leads to the false belief that we cause a lot of problems, when, in fact, we’re the only race that has never started a war anywhere outside of Africa!', 'make sure you taksdfsdfe their money and makeeserz sure that you fsadfasdfuuuuuck their sosdsdciety and leave !', 'I live in Switzerland. I haven’t experienced racism but I’ll say Swiss people are very stand offish though and have a hard time letting anyone non Swiss in their circle. It was the same with my Swiss husband’s family. Outside of his parents my first time meeting them was very uncomfortable for me. They’re just very “ close circle ish” but 7 years later you’d think we’ve known each out all our lives. \nSwiss people tend to live by rules and structures that they can’t seem to live outside of. My hubby lived in the US 15 years that’s how where met. He’d always say he’s nothing like the typical Swiss now that we live here. I can see exactly what he meant. Lol', 'Long talk not to the point. Looong taaalk.', ""I believe that we black people fantasize about a world without racism.\nHaving been born and raised in the US and having lived in several European countries, I learned that racism comes very naturally for Europeans or white people.  \nWe are in denial if we think that there are European countries that see black people as equal.  \nThey don't understand racism. Events like the holocaust was able to take place because they like to pretend that there is no problem.  \nI have no desire to live with those people, no matter how beautiful the country is.\nWe will never be enough for them."", 'NZ is beautiful like Switzerland. but so many racist Europeans have moved there now and unfortunately think they own the place.
